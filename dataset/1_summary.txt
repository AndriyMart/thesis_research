The dollar has reached its highest level against the euro in nearly three months after comments from Federal Reserve head Alan Greenspan indicated the US trade deficit may stabilize. Factors contributing to this potential stabilization include the US government's intent to curb spending and a rise in household savings. Market concerns about the deficit have recently weakened the dollar. However, the currency's value increased following Greenspan's optimistic speech in London before the G7 finance ministers' meeting. Despite this, worries persist over the deficit and China's fixed currency exchange rate, which continues to make Chinese exports highly competitive. While calls for China to alter its policy have been ignored, some believe the US Federal Reserve's recent decision to raise interest rates could boost the dollar's appeal.
