Microsoft is currently investigating a trojan named Bankash-A Trojan, which tries to deactivate the company's recently released anti-spyware software. The anti-spyware tool has already been downloaded by six million users. This malicious program, distributed via email attachments, aims not only to disable or delete Microsoft's anti-spyware tool and suppress user warning messages but also attempts to steal personal data such as online banking passwords by tracking keystrokes. Although Microsoft believes this threat isn't widespread, they recommend the use of an anti-virus program. This comes as the company plans to acquire anti-virus software creator Sybari Software to bolster the security of its Windows and email software, and also intends to offer its own paid anti-virus software in the future.
