Irish long-distance runner Sonia O'Sullivan aims to reclaim her title at the Bupa Great Ireland Run in Dublin on April 9th. O'Sullivan, who was the champion two years ago, ended up in fourth place in last year's event. Race director Matthew Turnbull reports that O'Sullivan has had a productive winter training season in Australia following a minor injury. The race will also see Mark Carroll, the Irish record holder for 3km, 5km, and 10km, participating for the first time in the 10km mass participation race. Carroll, who has been demonstrating impressive form recently, will be up against tough competition, including Australian Craig Mottram, the two-time winner of the Dublin race.
