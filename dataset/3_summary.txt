The Labour Party has confirmed that it will hold its 2006 autumn conference in Manchester, marking a departure from the tradition of choosing a seaside venue. This decision, approved by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee, makes it the first time since 1917 that Manchester has been selected to host the annual event. While the smaller February spring conference will be held in Blackpool as a compromise, the loss of the larger annual conference is seen as a significant blow to the coastal resort. Colin Asplin of the Blackpool Hotel Association expressed hope that Manchester would be able to accommodate the event. The exact financial impact on Blackpool in terms of lost hotel accommodation revenue is yet to be determined.
