Tate Britain art gallery in London has revealed a Christmas tree that can receive text messages. The tree, adorned with broken plates and light bulbs by sculptor Richard Wentworth, features an antenna that allows it to receive Bluetooth texts from gallery visitors. This year marks the 17th year the gallery has asked an artist to decorate their Christmas tree, with past participants including Tracey Emin in 2002. The plates on the tree will be auctioned off for children's charity ArtWorks. Wentworth, who was an assistant to Henry Moore in the late 1960s and has become a reputable sculptor and influential teacher, is known for his photography of mundane everyday subjects.
