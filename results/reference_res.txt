US media giant TimeWarner reported a 76% jump in quarterly profits to $1.13bn (Â£600m) for the last three months of the previous year, driven by sales of high-speed internet connections and higher advertising sales. Despite a decrease in AOL users and lower profits at Warner Bros, one-off gains offset these losses. The company, which owns an 8% stake in Google, plans to increase AOL's subscribers by offering free online services to TimeWarner internet customers. Despite a fall in the film division's profits, TimeWarner's annual profit grew by 27%, with revenues rising by 6.4%. The company is currently restating its 2000 and 2003 accounts due to an inquiry by the US Securities Exchange Commission into AOL.
